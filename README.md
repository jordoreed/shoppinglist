## Caveats

I didn't get around to making it _exactly_ like the designs. I've got take-homes and interviews from a lot of companies I simply don't have time.

If I were building to this for realsies I would have gone a lot harder on trying to extract all the colors out into some sort of theme file. I started down that route but ended up cutting corners to get this thing done.
